## Multiple Parts

Content that are split into multiple files can be stacked together if named correctly. Files should be named as follows:

- `Movie Name (2010)/Movie Name<separator><parttype><separator><partnumber>.mkv`

The separator is optional between `<parttype>` and `<partnumber>`. `<partnumber>` can be any number, or the letters a-d.

Supported part types are:

- `cd`
- `dvd`
- `part`
- `pt`
- `disc`
- `disk`

Supported separators are:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD038 -->

- ` ` (space)
- `.` (period)
- `-` (dash)
- `_` (underscore)

This does not work in conjunction with multiple versions or merging.
